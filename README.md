# Markov-Decision-Process
 an application of the markov decision process algorithm.
 
 this project is just meant to show the markov decision process thats used in reenforment leaning in action.

 i used tkinter to create a very crude layout / environment on which my agent will interact. the goal is to find a set destination
 
 the purpose of this project is mainly the appication of the MDP algorithm. every other aspects are mad crude and raw as it is not the focus 
 
 i implimented a roughly thought out "Random Search" algorithm that ensures the agent maps the environment before the implimentation of the MDP algorithm
